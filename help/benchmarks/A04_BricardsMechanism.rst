MBS Benchmark A04: Bricard's Mechanism
======================================

Benchmark Objective
-------------------
Bricard's mechanism (benchmark problem **A04**) :cite:`1897:bricard` is an example of over-constrained system.
Gr√ºbler's formula :cite:`1884:grubler` results in no degrees of freedom, however, the particular orientation of the revolute pairs results in a system with one degree of freedom.

Benchmark Description
---------------------

The system is composed of five rods with square cross section and six revolute joints. Gravity is acting towards the negative y direction.

Results
-------

The dynamic simulation of the **A04** benchmark was executed for 10 s. The previous figure shows the Bricard's Mechanism in its initial position.

Simulation evaluation has been conducted taking into account the total mechanical energy variation from the initial condition.
Total mechanical energy defined as the sum of the kinetic and potential energy of the mechanism.
Since no friction or dissipative elements are present in the mechanism energy should be conserved therefore theoretical value for the mechanical energy variation is zero.

Computational Performances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To compute the simulation the developed implementation required 0.258 seconds.

Results obtained using an Intel Core i5-4570 @ 3.2 GHz computer running Windows 8.1 64-bit.
OpenSim official release used: 3.2.
